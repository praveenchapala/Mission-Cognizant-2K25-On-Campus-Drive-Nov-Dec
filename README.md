Java Basics – Core Concepts and Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Java programs demonstrating the core concepts of Java programming. Each program focuses on a specific topic such as conditional statements, loops, patterns, functions, arrays, and basic mathematical operations.

The purpose of this repository is to help learners understand Java syntax and logic through clear and simple examples.

📌 Topics Covered
1. Conditional Statements

Age-based eligibility check

Largest of two numbers

Largest of three numbers

Even or odd number

Income tax calculation

Ternary operator usage

Switch-case calculator

2. Loops

While loop demonstration

For loop implementation

Do-while loop usage

Breaking loops with break

Printing number ranges

Sum of first N natural numbers

Reversing a number

3. Pattern Programs

Star pattern

4. Functions / Methods

Simple function example

Product of two numbers

Factorial calculation

Binomial coefficient calculation

Function overloading (parameters & datatypes)

Prime number checking

5. Arrays

Array creation

Accepting array input

Updating and printing array values

📂 Repository Structure

All Java programs are stored individually and demonstrate:

User input via Scanner

Decision-making using if-else and switch

Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)

Reusable functions and method overloading

Basic arrays and pattern printing

Mathematical operations with logic

This makes the repository ideal for students, beginners, and candidates preparing for interviews or exams.
